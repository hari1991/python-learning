print(2 + 2)

print(50 - 5*6)

print(50 - 5/6) # operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to floating point

print((50 - 5*6) / 4)

print(8 / 5)  # division always returns a floating point number

print(17 / 3)  # classic division returns a float


print(17 // 3)  # floor division discards the fractional part

print(17 % 3)  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division

print(5 * 3 + 2)  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder

print(5 ** 2)  # 5 squared

print(2 ** 7)  # 2 to the power of 7
