"""# -*- coding: ASCII -*-"""


"""
By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. With UTF-8, 
characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments.
The standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow.

To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.

To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line of the file. The syntax is as follows:

# -*- coding: encoding -*-

where encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.
